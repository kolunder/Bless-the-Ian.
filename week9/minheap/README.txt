Attached is the custom module to implement the Min Heap.

Objective: to understand the technology/algorithm/theory behind Min Heap with a future goal to implement Huffman Encoding algorithm.

Problem: I have produced a semi-functional module and belive I have encapsulated and formatted the whole thing correctly. However, I still can`t quite get my head around the Min Heap. Couple of questions.

	1) During my research I came across the dynamic array implementation. Is that any good? It seemed slightly weird and wonky to me.

	2)
