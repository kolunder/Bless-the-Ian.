Attached is the custom module to implement the Min Heap.

Objective: to understand the technology/algorithm/theory behind Min Heap with a future goal to implement Huffman Encoding algorithm.

Problem: I have produced a semi-functional module and belive I have encapsulated and formatted the whole thing correctly. However, I still can`t quite get my head around the entirety of the Min Heap. Couple of questions:

	1) During my research I came across the dynamic array implementation. Is that any good? It seemed slightly weird and wonky to me.

	2) Off-topic. Could you write me a couple of lines about how test.c works in the final assignemnt. I cant wrap my head around how is that supposed to interact with my code and test the calls made. So far I produced something that draws a line but draws gibberish for all other files.

Thank you for your time!
